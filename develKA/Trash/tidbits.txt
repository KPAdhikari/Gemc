As the grep result in tidbits_integrateDgt.txt shows, the integrateDgt method such as 

map<string, double> rtpc_HitProcess :: integrateDgt(MHit* aHit, int hitn) 

for each of the detectors is called from source/src/MEventAction.cc:740: as
        thisHitOutput.setDgtz(hitProcessRoutine->integrateDgt(aHit, h+1));

// - integrateDgt: returns digitized information integrated over the hit
// calling integrateDgt will also set writeHit
