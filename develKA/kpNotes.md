* I noticed on 1/18/21 that both rtpc__bank.txt and rtpc__hit_original.txt in detectors/clas12/rtpc have
all rows written twice. I believe that's due to a typo in some perl script that we run to update these
rtpc-detector/material/bank/hit configurations. I base that on my observation that no other detector files
have such repetitions/redundancies.
